# Flood-Segmentation-Project
This project implements a multi-class flood segmentation model using the DeepLabv3+ architecture. The primary goal is to accurately segment flood-affected areas in satellite or aerial images. The model is trained on a custom dataset and evaluated using metrics like IoU (Intersection over Union).
