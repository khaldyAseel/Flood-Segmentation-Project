# Flood Segmentation Project

## Overview
This project implements a multi-class flood segmentation model using the DeepLabv3+ architecture. The primary goal is to accurately segment flood-affected areas in satellite or aerial images. The model is trained on a custom dataset and evaluated using metrics like IoU (Intersection over Union).

## Features
- **DeepLabv3+ Architecture**: Utilized for advanced image segmentation.
- **Multi-class Segmentation**: Handles multiple classes in the dataset for precise area identification.
- **Custom Dataset Processing**: Includes data pre-processing, mask handling, and augmentation.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Implements a robust pipeline for training and testing the model.
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: Introduced techniques to address class imbalances for better performance.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of:
- **Images**: Flood-affected areas captured in RGB.
- **Masks**: Ground truth masks with multiple classes indicating different regions.

### Pre-processing Steps
1. Resized images and masks to 256x256 dimensions.
2. Converted masks for multi-class segmentation handling.
3. Applied data augmentations to increase dataset diversity.

## Model Training
- **Architecture**: DeepLabv3+ with a ResNet backbone.
- **Loss Function**: CrossEntropyLoss was used for multi-class segmentation.
- **Optimizer**: Adam optimizer with a learning rate scheduler.
- **Metrics**: Evaluated using Mean IoU and validation loss.
- **Epochs**: Trained for 15 epochs with a batch size of 4.

## Results
- **Train Loss**: Progressively reduced over epochs.
- **Validation Loss**: Monitored to ensure the model generalizes well.
- **IoU Score**: Improved after addressing class imbalance and optimizing hyperparameters.
